# Discord Mutual Friends and Servers

This is a simple Discord bot that allows you to gather a list of server members who are your friends, along with those you share mutual servers or mutual friends with.

**Note:**
This project is a proof of concept. Please be aware that the use of self bots is against Discord's terms of service. Engaging with this code is at your own risk, and any potential consequences, including account suspension, are your responsibility.

## Features

- List friends present in a server.
- List server members with mutual friends.
- List server members with mutual servers.

## Coming Soon

- Windows .exe and Mac .app
- Connections graph

## Building Windows .exe and Max .app from Source

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm main.spec
```

## Limitations

- If a server has more than 1000 members, this program is only able to retrieve
  the currently online members (unless you have the required permissions to
  request all server members)

## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Usage

1. Install all project [Requirements](#requirements)
2. Get your Discord token using the steps in the [How to Get Your Token](#how-to-get-your-token) section
3. Put your Discord token into `.env.sample` file
4. Rename the file `.env.sample` to `.env`
5. Install the requirements using the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run the main Python file with the command below, or customize the command with the options in the [Command-line Options](#command-line-options) section:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## How to Get Your Token

### Primary Method

If you are comfortable running JavaScript in the Developer Tools Console, the following method is the easiest:

1. Login to Discord's web app: [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)
2. Go to your browser's Developer Tools. In most browsers this can be done by pressing `âŒ˜ + Option + I` on macOS or `CTRL+ Shift + I` on Windows or Linux. `F12` may also work.
3. Paste the code snippet below. If this is your first time using the Developer Tools, you may need to type `allow pasting` first.

   ```javascript
     (webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken()
   ```

### Other Methods

Other methods that don't involve running JavaScript in the console:
